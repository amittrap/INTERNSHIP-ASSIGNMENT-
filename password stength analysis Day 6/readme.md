## üõ°Ô∏è Common Password Attacks

### 1. Brute Force Attack
- Attackers try **every possible combination** until the correct password is found.
- **Prevention:** Use long, complex passwords; enable MFA; implement account lockout policies.

### 2. Dictionary Attack
- Attackers use **precompiled lists of common words and passwords** to guess user passwords.
- **Prevention:** Avoid using common words or predictable sequences in passwords.

### 3. Credential Stuffing
- Attackers use **previously leaked username-password pairs** to try to log into other accounts.
- **Prevention:** Use unique passwords for each account; enable MFA.

### 4. Phishing
- Attackers trick users into **revealing passwords via fake websites or emails**.
- **Prevention:** Always verify links and sources; use email security filters; conduct security awareness training.

### 5. Rainbow Table Attack
- Attackers use **precomputed tables of hashed passwords** to reverse password hashes.
- **Prevention:** Salt all passwords; use strong, modern hashing algorithms like bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2.

| Attack Type           | Method                            | Prevention                                   |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Brute Force          | Tries all combinations            | Complex passwords, MFA, rate-limiting        |
| Dictionary Attack    | Tries common words/passwords       | Unique, unpredictable passwords              |
| Credential Stuffing  | Uses leaked credentials            | Unique passwords per site, MFA               |
| Phishing             | Tricks users to reveal passwords   | Awareness, source verification, email filters |
