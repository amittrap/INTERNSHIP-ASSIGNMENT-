ðŸ“š Detailed Interview Questions and Answers
1. What is a firewall?
A firewall is a security system (hardware or software) that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined rules. It acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network (like your home Wi-Fi or office LAN) and untrusted external networks (like the internet).

It can:

Block unwanted access (e.g., hackers or malware)

Allow safe communication (like browsing, video calls, or email)

Filter traffic based on IP address, port, protocol, or application

Example: Just like a security guard at a gate checks who can enter or exit, a firewall checks which data packets can go in or out of your system.

2. Difference between stateful and stateless firewall?
Feature	Stateless Firewall	Stateful Firewall
Memory	Doesnâ€™t remember previous packets	Keeps track of ongoing connections
Speed	Slightly faster, but less secure	Slightly slower, more secure
Decision Basis	Each packet is checked individually	Decision is made based on packet + session context
Use Case	Used in simple, low-security environments	Used in modern, high-security systems

Example:

Stateless: Treats every visitor at a door as new, even if they came in just 1 second ago.

Stateful: Remembers that a visitor just entered and tracks their movement inside.

3. What are inbound and outbound rules?
Inbound Rules control traffic coming into your system from outside (like someone accessing your website).

Outbound Rules control traffic leaving your system (like your browser sending a request to open google.com).

Example:

Inbound Rule: Allow port 22 (SSH) from all IPs.

Outbound Rule: Block all traffic to port 23 (Telnet).

These rules help you allow trusted traffic and block suspicious or unauthorized access.

4. How does UFW simplify firewall management?
UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) is designed to make managing firewall rules easy for beginners. Itâ€™s a user-friendly interface to iptables (which is more complex).

UFW simplifies things by:

Using easy-to-understand commands like ufw allow 22

Automatically handling low-level rule creation

Displaying readable status output

Example:
Instead of writing a long iptables command, UFW lets you simply write:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo ufw allow 80
to allow web traffic.

5. Why block port 23 (Telnet)?
Port 23 is used for the Telnet protocol, which allows remote access to another computer.

But Telnet is dangerous because:

It transmits data in plain text, including usernames and passwords

It has no encryption, making it easy for attackers to intercept

Itâ€™s outdated and replaced by SSH (port 22)

So: Blocking port 23 helps protect your system from being compromised via insecure remote access.

6. What are common firewall mistakes?
Some common firewall misconfigurations include:

Not allowing SSH before enabling the firewall â€“ which can lock you out

Allowing all ports or IP addresses â€“ this can expose you to attacks

Forgetting to block unused ports â€“ attackers can use open ports to find vulnerabilities

Not testing the firewall rules â€“ rules may not work as intended

Tip: Always test and double-check your firewall settings after making changes.

7. How does a firewall improve network security?
Firewalls protect systems by:

Blocking unauthorized access

Filtering malicious traffic like viruses or hackers

Allowing only trusted communications

Acting as a first line of defense for both individuals and organizations

They help reduce risks of data breaches, malware infections, and network takeovers.

8. What is NAT in firewalls?
NAT (Network Address Translation) is a method that allows multiple devices on a private network to access the internet using a single public IP address.

In firewalls, NAT is used to:

Hide internal IP addresses from external networks (for security)

Route requests and responses between internal devices and the internet

Example:
Your phone, laptop, and TV all use your routerâ€™s public IP to access the internet. NAT handles which device gets which data.
