# 🚀 Cyber Security Internship - Task 8: VPN Hands-On and Security Understanding

## 📄 Project Overview
This project focuses on gaining practical experience in setting up and using a VPN. The primary objective is to understand how VPNs enhance user privacy, secure online communications, and encrypt internet traffic.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Understand VPN architecture and encryption mechanisms.
- Learn to configure and use a VPN for private browsing.
- Verify IP address changes and traffic routing through VPN servers.
- Analyze VPN security features and performance impacts.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **VPN Client:** ProtonVPN (Free Tier)
- **IP Verification Tool:** [WhatIsMyIPAddress.com](https://www.whatismyipaddress.com/)
- **Web Browser:** Google Chrome

---

## ✅ Steps Performed
1. **VPN Selection and Download**
   - Selected ProtonVPN due to its privacy-centric approach.
   - Downloaded directly from [ProtonVPN Official Site](https://protonvpn.com).

2. **Installation**
   - Simple and clean installation with no additional permissions required.

3. **Account Setup**
   - Created a ProtonVPN account using a secure email.
   - No sensitive personal information was required.

4. **VPN Connection**
   - Connected to the fastest available server via ProtonVPN client.

5. **IP Address Verification**
   - Verified IP address change before and after VPN connection using whatismyipaddress.com.

6. **Secure Browsing Confirmation**
   - Browsed securely and confirmed IP masking.

7. **VPN Disconnection and Speed Test**
   - Checked IP address restoration and experienced a slight speed improvement after disconnection.

8. **Research on VPN Security**
   - Analyzed ProtonVPN’s encryption protocols and privacy features:
     - AES-256 encryption
     - OpenVPN & IKEv2/IPSec
     - No-logs policy
     - DNS leak protection
     - Kill switch

## 🔐 VPN Benefits
- **Privacy Protection:** Hides the user's real IP address.
- **Secure Data Transmission:** Encrypts internet traffic.
- **Access to Geo-Restricted Content:** Enables bypassing regional restrictions.
- **Public Wi-Fi Protection:** Shields data on unsecured networks.

---

## ⚙️ VPN Limitations
- **Potential Speed Reduction:** Encryption overhead may cause slower browsing.
- **Limited Free Servers:** Free tiers often restrict server options and speed.
- **Not Fully Anonymous:** VPNs improve privacy but do not offer complete anonymity.
- **Trust Dependency:** Relies heavily on VPN provider’s integrity and no-log policy.

---

## 📚 Learnings
- VPNs are essential for enhancing online privacy and securing sensitive information.
- Practical VPN use requires awareness of provider trustworthiness and potential speed trade-offs.
- Hands-on testing is crucial to verify IP masking and encryption effectiveness.
